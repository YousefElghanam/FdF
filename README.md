## FdF - Wireframe Renderer
FdF is a project focused on basic graphics programming in C. The goal is to create a 3D wireframe representation of a terrain using a 2D projection.
Given a map file containing elevation data, the program reads and renders a grid of points connected by lines, simulating a 3D landscape.

### This project involves:

#### Parsing and interpreting elevation data from a file

#### Projecting 3D coordinates into 2D space (isometric or parallel projection)

#### Drawing lines using Bresenhamâ€™s algorithm

#### Handling user input for zoom, rotation, translation, and altitude scaling

#### Using the MiniLibX library for window management and pixel rendering

### FdF is a great introduction to computer graphics and low-level programming, providing a hands-on experience with coordinate systems, data visualization, and graphical user interaction.
